    "The main components applied to construct this experimental rig are the following:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Pump:** Since the system will involve contaminants in the fluid, a peristaltic pump has been used as its mechanism is more tolerant to particles in the liquid. A Masterflex® SN-77921-70 (Drive: 07523-80, Two Heads: 77200-62, Tubing: L/S© 24) model peristaltic pump was installed in the system to maintain the flow of the prepared suspension. The pump is a positive displacement source, providing a flow rate ranging from 0.28 to 1700 ml/min (i.e. from 0.1 to 600 RPM).\r\n",
    "- \r\n",
    "- **Dampener:** The aim of using rigid tubing is to prevent the system from unwanted tube expansion due to pressure build up, which affects the actual pressure build up generated from filter clogging. A Masterflex® pulse dampener is installed on the downstream side of pump to eliminate any pulsation in flow.A majority of the system is furnished with a rigid polypropylene tubing, whereas the pump side is covered with a flexible Tygon® LFL pump tubing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Particles:** The suspension is composed of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) particles and water. PEEK particles have a density (1.3g/cm3) close to that of room temperature water and have significantly low water absorption level (0.1% / 24 hours, ASTM D570). Having a low water absorption level will prevent particles expanding when they mix with water. Subsequently, closer density with water allows particles to suspend longer in water.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Flow Rate Sensor:** A GMAG100 series electromagnetic flow meter (measurement range: 3 – 25,000 millilitres per minute) is installed in the system to keep track of the flow rate in the system.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Pressure Sensors:** Upstream and downstream Ashcroft® G2 pressure transducers (measurement range: 0 – 100 PSI) are installed in the system to capture the pressure drop (i.e. ‘ΔP’) across the filter, which is considered as the main indicator of clogging.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Filter:** the filter has a pore mesh size of 125µm."
